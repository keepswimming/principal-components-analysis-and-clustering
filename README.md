Explain why clustering methods are unsupervised methods.
Identify situations in which clustering is appropriate (versus classification or predictive methods).
Define hierarchical and non-hierarchical modeling methods.
Distinguish between hierarchical and non-hierarchical modeling methods and compare in context.
Apply hierarchical clustering with the hclust function.
Apply one method of non-hierarchical clustering with the kmeans function.
Explain why principal components analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised method.
Visualize the components of PCA using appropriate tools.
Define and interpret principal components and loadings.
Select an appropriate number of components.
Apply PCA with the prcomp function.
